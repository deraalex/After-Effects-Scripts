APC - Parent Morph


1. Installation

Copy the File to your Presets Folder
  .../After Effects/Presets/
  

2. What is Parent Morph

Parent Morph creates Expressions to Position, Scale, Rotation and Opacity to your Layer which you can control via the APC Parent Morph Pseudo Effect.


3. How to use it

Set the Target Layers and use the weight Slider. Parent Morph adapts the behavior of the Chosen Layer. You can switch between both Layers by moving the weight Slider to a negative or positive Value. Negative is Parent Layer 1 and vice versa.
If you want to control only a specific Transformation Property, choose it via the Checkbox of the Controller.

There are two ways to blend between the targets: soft and hard. Soft means that the slider goes directly from value a to value b and blends smoothly between both. Hard goes from value a to zero and then to value b.


4. Where should i use it

For example in Character Animations. You have 2 Nulls with Movement for a Hand, you put the Preset an the Hand Controller and then you can choose the Movement. 


5. Supported Versions

I tested it in After Effects CC2019 and CC2020.
